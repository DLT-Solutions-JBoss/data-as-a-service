# data-as-a-service
This repository contains components necessary to create a Data as a Service (DaaS) layer that allows clients to attach to one data service to access many data at rest repositories on the back end.  This project uses Red Hat's JBoss Data Virtualization to create the DaaS and Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) running within OpenShift Container Platform to create a mobile client.
